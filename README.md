# MagicMorse
Magic Morse decoder Arduino nano with Nokia display

Morse code trainer with laser marked mount in blue EM30 GRP.
I’ve never tried marking this GRP before, the contrast is a little low but quite acceptable for the purpose. The settings used were something like 200mm/s at 10mA. The material is 10mm thick so the focus was way out as I didn’t adjust for that.
